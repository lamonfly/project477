## Newton's Cradle Project
This is a physics-based simulation of a Newton’s Cradle in 3D. The project allows the user to modify certain aspects of the cradle, such as the number of balls or its starting position. The simulation is built in such a way as to let the user be able to select and modify their variables as they see fit. The objective of this simulation is to develop an environment where the program runs depending on the values input by the user in order to create a multitude of scenarios of varying combinations of parameters. These parameters would be used in a simulated physics environment to recreate the action that would be observed from the collision and the transferal of energy of the physical balls in a real-life newton’s cradle.

To recreate the device, physics is needed. To start off, we need to have constant variables such as acceleration, which is the gravity, mass, and radius of the sphere.

G = 9.82 m/s^2

The mass and the radius of the sphere will also be kept constant. However, the value can be fixed to any number. The higher the mass and the height, the faster the velocity. These variables will be used for Newton’s law of motion, which the mass and acceleration are used to find the force used in the device.

F = m a

### Demonstration
In the video demos below, there will examples of how the Newton's cradle works in our project.

[![Project Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/mwTcAQyYwdU/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/mwTcAQyYwdU)

In the first example, there is a single pendulum and with no damping, it will swing continuously.

Since it is a Newton's cradle, the user can add or take away balls from the simulation.

There is a red marker on the pendulum which helps the user highlight the ball they want to swing in the simulation when there are multiple pendulums.

In the next example, the simulation shows that the user can swing 3 pendulums at a time and shows the result. This can be done on either side as shown.

The program also allows the user to increase the animation speed as well as the effects of damping.


[![Project Demo 2](https://img.youtube.com/vi/vVz7u4vmJ2c/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vVz7u4vmJ2c)

In this demo video above, the user can move two of the pendulums and then play the animation.

The user can also move the camera around for a better look or a top view.
